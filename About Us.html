        <p>Delaware is the first state, and the one that we hail from. It is also the second smallest state. Its small size, as well as position near large metropolises such as Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington D.C. makes it full of important travel routes, especially in the northern and most populous parts of Delaware.</p><br>
