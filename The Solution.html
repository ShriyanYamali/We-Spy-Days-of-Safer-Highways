    <hr>
    <div class="highlight-area">
        Our proposed solution to the speeding and accident related issues on Kirkwood Highway is the implementation of a speed camera. Speed cameras are a modern technology that can identify overspeeding vehicles, allowing officials to distribute consequences to potential accident creators. This would discourage the reckless speeding that is seen all too much, and help fortify the roadway in terms of traffic safety. Being a technological solution, speed cameras could catch speeders 24-7, and would be incapable of having biases. In addition, speed cameras are completely constitutional, and have even been proven to work in many other places. With the <a href="https://news.delaware.gov/2023/06/30/governor-carney-signs-package-of-roadway-safety-legislation/">recent package of roadway safety laws</a> approved in Delaware, speed cameras could be the perfect way to enforce new laws, a huge step in the right direction of roadway safety for all in our area. In order to make this vision of a speed camera on Kirkwood Highway come true, we students have completed multiple action steps, which you can see in the table below. Even you could take action steps to help this cause, by making use of the "Ways to Give" and "Donate" buttons on this website.
