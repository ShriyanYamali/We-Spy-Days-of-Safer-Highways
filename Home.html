        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
    Our mission is to advocate for the installation of a speed camera on Kirkwood Highway in 
    Delaware, driven by our commitment to enhancing traffic safety. As two impassioned students, we 
    strive to raise awareness and rally community support for this vital initiative. 
    Through collaboration with local authorities, engaging educational campaigns, and active 
    involvement in our community, we aim to reduce speeding violations, prevent accidents, and 
    ultimately create a safer environment for all road users. Our dedication to promoting responsible 
    driving behavior and safeguarding lives fuels our determination to see the implementation of this
    speed camera, ensuring the well-being and security of our community.

                Speed Cameras have been used throughout <br>
                the country in many places. The use of <br>speed  
                cameras in Delaware has been previously<br>
                implemented in certain areas, however, on <br> 
                Kirkwood Highway speed cameras have a <br>
                chance to save lives.

                As residents of Delaware our whole lives, <br>
                we have always had a keen interest in<br>
                Delaware's traffic safety. We started<br>
                this project back in September of 2023<br>
                and plan to continue working on traffic<br>
                safety in Delaware until we can insure<br>
                that our roads are safe.<br>

                Since 2020, traffic deaths have been slowly increasing with <br>2022 being the 
                most traffic deaths Delaware has ever seen.
