    <hr>
    <div class="highlight-area"><p> Kirkwood Highway, otherwise known as SR2, is an important major roadway in Delaware. However, it is also one that is often the unfortunate victim of roadway accidents. These crashes occur commonly and have a large impact on everyone in the Delaware area. Not only do the crashes cause injuries and even death, but they cause major roadway closures that can last up to hours. These closures are especially severe in such a small state, resulting in thousands who are unable to reach their jobs, homes, stores, and elsewhere. Even those from other states can be impacted, as northern Delaware is a major travel route due to its situation between major citizens. This exceedingly important issue is the one that us anonymous students have chosen for our Project Citizen. Project Citizen is a required academic endeavor that Delawarean high school freshmen are required to partake in. It is a model of the real world, in which students must research problems in their community and find ways to solve them. If you would like to help us in this endeavor, please check out the "Donate" and "Ways to Give" buttons on this website. </p></div>
